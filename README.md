Hello Everyone! :D

So my name is Nate. I'm currently taking courses on Full Stack Development. Its so far a really great course.

I have to say I've learned a thing or two so far, and even made money off the knowledge I have gained. A new website client came to me and I used my knowledge of Bootstrap to make them an awesome website, http://sheilamatin.com . Check it out :D

So its not in any particular order but pretty much goes like this.

1.)Blog POst = Learning Essential of HTML and CSS
2.)imgGallery1 = Learning Essential of HTML and CSS
3.)ToggleBackground = HTML and CSS
4.)LandingPage = BootStrap and intermediate HTML CSS
5.)ScoreKeeper = Learning to apply JavaScript, HTML and CSS
6.)ColorGame = Advancing through Javascript, HTML and CSS

more to come.

Best,
Nate O
